#The Git concepts I struggled with is the the GitHub Workflow. 
Most specifically, I had trouble deciding which branch needs to get pushed to GitHub onto the remote repository and which to pull down to the local repository.

#This topic was thoroughly explored. The guide explained the commands, while 
also telling us about the concepts. He brought a broader perspective on the GitHub workflow by referring it to a loop and clarifying what step follows the previous loop. 

#Again, since the the workflow was a bit confusing, I mainly asked 
for clarification while my partner and I ran the commands. 

#There was a lot to go over, and one question that I overlooked has to do with 
the initial push to the remote repository. In the lesson plans, the command is run like this : git push origin master. However, I'm not sure if it is best practice to create a branch after pulling down the remote repository and then merging it with the master on the local branch before pushing it back to the remote. 

#I thought the GPS pairing session was extremely helpful. For one thing, it 
exposed any weaknesses or uncertainties, going through the Releases, which is the perfect environment for this, since the Guide is there to answer any questions.
