**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I had a few questions at the start of the meeting that the guide helped me out with. I was unclear on where to create files, whether on the master or a feature branch, and then how to make sure that they all went up to GitHub correctly. Before our GPS he took some time to explain these, which was really helpful, and I think I understand better now. 

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

The concept we went over the most was basic GitHub flow. Cloning down off of GitHub and then pushing back up. This was a little foggy, and I am still working through this, but deifinitely clearer than before. 


**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

We asked clarification questions to the guide along the way if we were unsure. And to my pair, we asked each other for help when we weren't sure what to type and just checked back with each other constantly. 


**What still confuses you about Git?**

I think that I still need to spend a lot more time working with it and getting comfortable. I asked all of the questions I had during the GPS and got very good answers, but I know there is a lot that I don't even know exists yet. I still feel a little bit shaky on everything, but that confidence will hopefully come with more practice. 

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

I really liked it! I think at first, it was a little odd and awkward to have someone watching over us, but once we got settled it was very helpful. I think the guide was very helpful in answering questions and explaining things thouroughly when we got stuck. I am definitely glad that we have an outlet to speak to someone more experience than me once a week.
